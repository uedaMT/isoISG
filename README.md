# isoISG
Welcome to our repository, which serves as a source of annotation data, scripts, and supplementary data for our paper titled "Functional and Dynamic Profiling of Transcript Isoforms Reveals Essential Roles of Alternative Splicing in Interferon Response."

In this study, we generated a novel isoform annotation for IFN-Î±-stimulated and unstimulated B-cells called isoISG (isoforms of Interferon-Stimulated Genes). This was accomplished using the advanced PacBio sequencing platforms (Sequel II/IIe), enabling us to explore the complex landscape of alternative splicing events triggered by the interferon response.

To explore the isoISG annotation further, we have made available the following files:<br><br>
